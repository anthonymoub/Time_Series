Movies happen to be the most advanced type of storytelling, and they answer all these questions using creativity. My very first childhood memory I have with my father is when he took me to watch the first “Iron Man” back in 2008, and ever since that moment, I have become a movie addict.\n\nFueled by my deep passion for the film industry, I have chosen to apply the time series analysis skills I am acquiring in this course to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the industry.

It will also encompass forecasting methodologies.\n\n* Reviews and Public Perception: A look at the evolution of public perception regarding films over time. This analysis will primarily include the examination of film reviews and social media sentiment analysis.\n\n* Industry Financial Insights: This section will predominantly revolve around the in-depth analysis of the film industry's financial aspects, including the performance of film studio stocks and production costs.\n\n![Image 1: Project Overview](img/Flow_Chart.png)\n\nThe range of topics to explore within each of the aforementioned sections/angles is extensive. However, for this project, I have chosen to address a selection of questions pertaining to each angle. These questions encompass:\n\n* How has the overall box office evolved over the years?\n* What markets, namely the US versus international, have commanded the largest share of box office revenues?\n* Which film genres have been associated with the highest box office returns, and has this association changed over time?\n* How has the streaming industry affect the Box Office of movies?\n* Can Time Series models effectively forecast the US box office performance of a film?\n* How has the sentiment of movie reviews shifted throughout the years?\n* Has there consistently existed a disparity between audience scores and critic scores?\n* Is it feasible for a time series model to predict the score of an upcoming movie?\n* How have production costs and budgets fluctuated over the years?\n* In what manner has the return on investment (ROI) of films changed over the years, and how does it correlate with a film's success?\n\n\nEach of the above questions and topics will be addressed via different sets of visualizations, statistical analysis, and time series models that will give different inisights.\n\n### Literature Review\n\nBelow are a couple of studies and articles that will serve as references moving forward with the project:\n\n* https://www.researchgate.net/publication/361884293_Exploiting_time_series_based_story_plot_popularity_for_movie_success_prediction\n* https://eudl.eu/pdf/10.4108/eai.23-12-2022.2329074\n* http://journal.kci.go.kr/jksci/archive/articleView?artiId=ART002596610\n* https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389041718300731\n* https://towardsdatascience.com/a-new-approach-to-film-making-80cec94284f0\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n# Time Series and the Movie Industry {.main_title}\n\n![](img/movies.jpeg)\n\nIf we go back in history, we can clearly see that as a species we have always been known to be story tellers, whether it is drawing our stories on cave walls or telling our stories around a campfire; the stories we tell have always been a representation of who we are, where we come from, and who we want to be.
