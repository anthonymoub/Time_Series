    "text": "About Me\nMy name is Anthony and I am from Lebanon. I did my undergraduate studies at the Lebanese American University and majored in Industrial Engineering. Halfway through my undergrad, I developed an interest in Data Science and decided to study it on my own via online courses and personal projects to make sure it is the field I wanted to work in, which turned out to be the case as I was instantly captivated by the field’s interdisciplinary nature that could be applicable in a variety of industries.\nI am a very multi-dimensional person and have several hobbies including CrossFit (and many other forms of fitness), playing the electric guitar, watching podcasts on various topics (a very underrated form of intellect in my opinion), and many more. As for my passions, I am a film enthusiast and could spend hours talking about movies and how they mirror humans and society in general, a Metalhead (from indie Red Hot Chili Peppers type of rock all the way to SlipKnot metal style), and I am also very interested in psychology and philosophy.\nI firmly believe that I should eventually work at a company that I actually believe in and in their products, as I aim to look at my job as my purpose, in the sense of contributing to an environment that serves the world products that are impactful and that matter. That being said, upon graduation I see myself working as a Data Scientist in an industry that revolves around a passion of mine. Netflix, Spotify, WHOOP, are examples of companies that I would love to work in as I would be directly contributing to the world of film,music, fitness."

    "text": "Time Series and the Movie Industry\n\nIf we go back in history, we can clearly see that as a species we have always been known to be story tellers, whether it is drawing our stories on cave walls or telling our stories around a campfire; the stories we tell have always been a representation of who we are, where we come from, and who we want to be. Movies happen to be the most advanced type of storytelling, and they answer all these questions using creativity. My very first childhood memory I have with my father is when he took me to watch the first “Iron Man” back in 2008, and ever since that moment, I have become a movie addict.\nFueled by my deep passion for the film industry, I have chosen to apply the time series analysis skills I am acquiring in this course to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the industry. My goal is to analyze it rigorously from various technical perspectives and delve into the profound transformations that time has wrought upon the film industry.\nIn addition to being a passion project of mine, the film industry is one of the most numbers and data centric industries out there\nThis project aims to analyze the film industry from a variety of angles including:\n\nBox Office Analysis: This section entails a time series analysis of the box office performance of films throughout the years. It will also encompass forecasting methodologies.\nReviews and Public Perception: A look at the evolution of public perception regarding films over time. This analysis will primarily include the examination of film reviews and social media sentiment analysis.\nIndustry Financial Insights: This section will predominantly revolve around the in-depth analysis of the film industry’s financial aspects, including the performance of film studio stocks and production costs.\n\n\n\n\nImage 1: Project Overview\n\n\nThe range of topics to explore within each of the aforementioned sections/angles is extensive. However, for this project, I have chosen to address a selection of questions pertaining to each angle. These questions encompass:\n\nHow has the overall box office evolved over the years?\nWhat markets, namely the US versus international, have commanded the largest share of box office revenues?\nWhich film genres have been associated with the highest box office returns, and has this association changed over time?\nHow has the streaming industry affect the Box Office of movies?\nCan Time Series models effectively forecast the US box office performance of a film?\nHow has the sentiment of movie reviews shifted throughout the years?\nHas there consistently existed a disparity between audience scores and critic scores?\nIs it feasible for a time series model to predict the score of an upcoming movie?\nHow have production costs and budgets fluctuated over the years?\nIn what manner has the return on investment (ROI) of films changed over the years, and how does it correlate with a film’s success?\n\nEach of the above questions and topics will be addressed via different sets of visualizations, statistical analysis, and time series models that will give different inisights.\n\nLiterature Review\nBelow are a couple of studies and articles that will serve as references moving forward with the project:\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/361884293_Exploiting_time_series_based_story_plot_popularity_for_movie_success_prediction\nhttps://eudl.eu/pdf/10.4108/eai.23-12-2022.2329074\nhttp://journal.kci.go.kr/jksci/archive/articleView?artiId=ART002596610\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389041718300731\nhttps://towardsdatascience.com/a-new-approach-to-film-making-80cec94284f0"

    "text": "Any metric that is measured over regular time intervals makes a Time Series. A time series is a sequence of data points or observations collected or recorded over a period of time at specific, equally spaced intervals. Each data point in a time series is associated with a particular timestamp or time period, making it possible to analyze and study how a particular variable or phenomenon changes over time. Time series data can be found in various domains and can represent a wide range of phenomena, including financial data, economic indicators, weather measurements, stock prices, sales figures, and more.\n\nExample: Weather data, Stock prices, Industry forecasts, etc are some of the common ones.\n\nThe analysis of experimental data that have been observed at different points in time leads to new and unique problems in statistical modeling and inference.\nThe obvious correlation introduced by the sampling of adjacent points in time can severely restrict the applicability of the many conventional statistical methods traditionally dependent on the assumption that these adjacent observations are independent and identically distributed.\n\nKey characteristics of time series data include:\nTemporal Order: Time series data is ordered chronologically, with each data point representing an observation at a specific point in time. The order of data points is critical for understanding trends and patterns over time.\nEqually Spaced Intervals: In most cases, time series data is collected at regular intervals, such as hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly. However, irregularly spaced time series data can also exist.\nDependency: Time series data often exhibits temporal dependency, meaning that the value at a given time is influenced by or related to the values at previous times. This dependency can take various forms, including trends, seasonality. This serial correlation is called as autocorrelation.\nComponents: Time series data can typically be decomposed into various components, including:\nTrend: The long-term movement or direction in the data. Seasonality: Repeating patterns or cycles that occur at fixed intervals. Noise/Irregularity: Random fluctuations or variability in the data that cannot be attributed to the trend or seasonality.\nApplications: Time series data is widely used for various applications, including forecasting future values, identifying patterns and anomalies, understanding underlying trends, and making informed decisions based on historical data.\nAnalyzing time series data involves techniques like time series decomposition, smoothing, statistical modeling, and forecasting. This class will cover but not be limited to traditional time series modeling including ARIMA, SARIMA, the multivariate Time Series modeling including; ARIMAX, SARIMAX, and VAR models, Financial Time Series modeling including; ARCH, GARCH models, and E-GARCH, M-GARCH..ect, Bayesian structural time series (BSTS) models, Spectral Analysis and Deep Learning Techniques for Time Series. Researchers and analysts use software tools like Python, R, and specialized time series libraries to work with and analyze time series data effectively.\nTime series analysis is essential in fields such as finance, economics, epidemiology, environmental science, engineering, and many others, as it provides insights into how variables change over time and allows for the development of predictive models to forecast future trends and outcomes."

    "text": "A notable and broad observation is the evolution of weekend box office results from 1977 to 2023. The initial and unmistakable trend is the nearly exponential growth in weekly box office earnings over time. In the past, weekend box office earnings were typically in the range of a couple of million dollars, whereas nowadays, they often reach into the tens or even hundreds of millions.\nThese results are in line with the significant expansion of the movie industry over the last few decades. Ticket prices have risen in response to inflation, and movies have become a much more substantial and influential part of popular culture as time has progressed.\nRegarding seasonality and cyclic patterns, it appears that there are consistent recurring cycles throughout this time period, although a more detailed analysis of these patterns will be conducted in the EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) section. Additionally, there seems to be a continuous increase in the difference between the lowest and highest points, and this gap appears to be widening as time goes on.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most obvious facts is that certain types of movies consistently outperform others at the box office. For instance, franchise movies, such as superhero films, have consistently demonstrated stronger performance compared to other genres. Remarkably, when we examine the top 10 highest-grossing movies of all time, only one, “Titanic,” does not belong to a major intellectual property or franchise. Therefore, it is sensible to analyze the top box office performers within different genres over time.\nThe animated plot presented above illustrates the genres that have dominated the box office each year. Surprisingly, the number of films winning the weekend box office in various genres varies widely from year to year. Genres like Action and Drama often cover the majority of box office winners. However, this pattern can be explained by the infrequent release of big franchise movies. Producing such films entails significant costs and time, resulting in less frequent releases. Conversely, there is a consistent influx of drama and low-budget movies being released every week, contributing to a more diverse distribution of box office results across genres.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother layer of analysis worth exploring is whether critically acclaimed movies tend to top the box office or not. To investigate this, the plot above utilizes data from Rotten Tomatoes, the most widely recognized platform for aggregating critic movie reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, movies are categorized as either “Fresh” or “Rotten.” “Fresh” signifies movies with ratings above 60%, indicating that 60% or more of critics gave the film a positive review, while the rest are considered “Rotten.”\nExamining the distribution of movies in these two categories is quite intriguing. It reveals an almost even split, with roughly half of the movies classified as “Fresh” and the other half as “Rotten.” This suggests that there isn’t an overwhelming reliance on a movie’s critical reception for its opening weekend success. However, the story may differ when considering a movie’s long-term box office performance, as a film is less likely to have staying power if it doesn’t receive positive reviews from critics.\nThis observation could be a subtle indication that factors like hype and marketing might exert a more significant influence on a movie’s opening weekend performance compared to critic ratings. For instance, franchises like “Fast & Furious” consistently perform well in their opening weekends despite not always receiving favorable critical acclaim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis analysis delves into the financial sector of the movie industry, specifically highlighting stock performances of major Hollywood studios. Our focus is on Disney, Paramount, Lionsgate, Warner Bros, and Netflix. While there are numerous studios in the industry, these selected entities provide a comprehensive insight into the sector’s financial landscape. Notably, we’ve included Netflix to represent the growing impact of streaming services in this traditionally cinema-focused industry.\nA standout observation is Netflix’s meteoric rise in stock prices. The growth trajectory of Netflix’s stock, in many instances, has eclipsed the combined growth of some of the other studios. This surge underscores investors’ confidence in Netflix’s future potential. It suggests a broader industry trend where streaming platforms could challenge, if not dethrone, traditional movie theaters as the primary venues for film viewing. The rise of Netflix is not just a testament to its success as a streaming service but positions it as a formidable player in the entertainment sector, transcending its initial label as merely a tech company.\nHowever, a nuanced view, especially when analyzing normalized stock prices, reveals a consistent growth story for Disney. Unlike the erratic stock performances of other studios, Disney’s stock has shown steady growth. Curiously, despite Netflix’s overwhelming growth in absolute terms, when assessed against normalized metrics, its behavior mirrors that of other major studios. A potential explanation could be the cyclical nature of the industry, marked by periods of hit releases and lulls, impacting all players uniformly over time.\nOn the cinematic front, Paramount historically dominated the charts, boasting the highest number of weekly box office toppers for an extended period. However, the tide seemed to turn in favor of Disney. This shift is unsurprising, given Disney’s strategic acquisitions over the years. Their portfolio now includes powerhouses like Marvel, Lucasfilm, and Pixar. The consistent release of blockbuster titles from these franchises has cemented Disney’s position at the pinnacle of box office charts.\nIn summary, while streaming giants like Netflix are making waves in the stock market, traditional studios, especially Disney, with its strategic acquisitions and diverse portfolio, continue to hold their ground, both in stock performance and cinematic dominance."

However, this upward trajectory is accompanied by substantial fluctuations, indicative of pronounced volatility in the temperature data. This temperature pattern aligns logically with seasonal changes, as January typically ushers in the winter season, characterized by lower temperatures, with subsequent months witnessing a gradual warming trend. The cyclic “M” shape in the data underscores the regularity of these temperature fluctuations throughout the ascending period, underscoring the predictable yet dynamic nature of seasonal temperature shifts."

    "text": "The trajectory of the unemployment rate between 1990 and 2020 is notably absent of any discernible consistent trend in either direction. Instead, it exhibits a recurrent pattern reminiscent of an “A,” albeit with varying magnitudes across different periods. However, the year 2020 stands out as an exceptional anomaly in this pattern, as the unemployment rate soared to an all-time high. This significant spike in unemployment in 2020 can be readily attributed to the profound impact that the COVID-19 pandemic had on society, causing widespread economic disruptions and leading to substantial job losses. Consequently, while the unemployment rate’s historical fluctuations may follow a recurring pattern, the unprecedented events of 2020 underline the disruptive force of external factors on the labor market."
