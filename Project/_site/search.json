    "text": "About Me\nMy name is Anthony and I am from Lebanon. I did my undergraduate studies at the Lebanese American University and majored in Industrial Engineering. Halfway through my undergrad, I developed an interest in Data Science and decided to study it on my own via online courses and personal projects to make sure it is the field I wanted to work in, which turned out to be the case as I was instantly captivated by the field’s interdisciplinary nature that could be applicable in a variety of industries.\nI am a very multi-dimensional person and have several hobbies including CrossFit (and many other forms of fitness), playing the electric guitar, watching podcasts on various topics (a very underrated form of intellect in my opinion), and many more. As for my passions, I am a film enthusiast and could spend hours talking about movies and how they mirror humans and society in general, a Metalhead (from indie Red Hot Chili Peppers type of rock all the way to SlipKnot metal style), and I am also very interested in psychology and philosophy.\nI firmly believe that I should eventually work at a company that I actually believe in and in their products, as I aim to look at my job as my purpose, in the sense of contributing to an environment that serves the world products that are impactful and that matter. That being said, upon graduation I see myself working as a Data Scientist in an industry that revolves around a passion of mine. Netflix, Spotify, WHOOP, are examples of companies that I would love to work in as I would be directly contributing to the world of film,music, fitness."

    "text": "Any metric that is measured over regular time intervals makes a Time Series. A time series is a sequence of data points or observations collected or recorded over a period of time at specific, equally spaced intervals. Each data point in a time series is associated with a particular timestamp or time period, making it possible to analyze and study how a particular variable or phenomenon changes over time. Time series data can be found in various domains and can represent a wide range of phenomena, including financial data, economic indicators, weather measurements, stock prices, sales figures, and more.\n\nExample: Weather data, Stock prices, Industry forecasts, etc are some of the common ones.\n\nThe analysis of experimental data that have been observed at different points in time leads to new and unique problems in statistical modeling and inference.\nThe obvious correlation introduced by the sampling of adjacent points in time can severely restrict the applicability of the many conventional statistical methods traditionally dependent on the assumption that these adjacent observations are independent and identically distributed.\n\nKey characteristics of time series data include:\nTemporal Order: Time series data is ordered chronologically, with each data point representing an observation at a specific point in time. The order of data points is critical for understanding trends and patterns over time.\nEqually Spaced Intervals: In most cases, time series data is collected at regular intervals, such as hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly. However, irregularly spaced time series data can also exist.\nDependency: Time series data often exhibits temporal dependency, meaning that the value at a given time is influenced by or related to the values at previous times. This dependency can take various forms, including trends, seasonality. This serial correlation is called as autocorrelation.\nComponents: Time series data can typically be decomposed into various components, including:\nTrend: The long-term movement or direction in the data. Seasonality: Repeating patterns or cycles that occur at fixed intervals. Noise/Irregularity: Random fluctuations or variability in the data that cannot be attributed to the trend or seasonality.\nApplications: Time series data is widely used for various applications, including forecasting future values, identifying patterns and anomalies, understanding underlying trends, and making informed decisions based on historical data.\nAnalyzing time series data involves techniques like time series decomposition, smoothing, statistical modeling, and forecasting. This class will cover but not be limited to traditional time series modeling including ARIMA, SARIMA, the multivariate Time Series modeling including; ARIMAX, SARIMAX, and VAR models, Financial Time Series modeling including; ARCH, GARCH models, and E-GARCH, M-GARCH..ect, Bayesian structural time series (BSTS) models, Spectral Analysis and Deep Learning Techniques for Time Series. Researchers and analysts use software tools like Python, R, and specialized time series libraries to work with and analyze time series data effectively.\nTime series analysis is essential in fields such as finance, economics, epidemiology, environmental science, engineering, and many others, as it provides insights into how variables change over time and allows for the development of predictive models to forecast future trends and outcomes."

    "text": "A notable and broad observation is the evolution of weekend box office results from 1977 to 2023. The initial and unmistakable trend is the nearly exponential growth in weekly box office earnings over time. In the past, weekend box office earnings were typically in the range of a couple of million dollars, whereas nowadays, they often reach into the tens or even hundreds of millions.\nThese results are in line with the significant expansion of the movie industry over the last few decades. Ticket prices have risen in response to inflation, and movies have become a much more substantial and influential part of popular culture as time has progressed.\nRegarding seasonality and cyclic patterns, it appears that there are consistent recurring cycles throughout this time period, although a more detailed analysis of these patterns will be conducted in the EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) section. Additionally, there seems to be a continuous increase in the difference between the lowest and highest points, and this gap appears to be widening as time goes on.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most obvious facts is that certain types of movies consistently outperform others at the box office. For instance, franchise movies, such as superhero films, have consistently demonstrated stronger performance compared to other genres. Remarkably, when we examine the top 10 highest-grossing movies of all time, only one, “Titanic,” does not belong to a major intellectual property or franchise. Therefore, it is sensible to analyze the top box office performers within different genres over time.\nThe animated plot presented above illustrates the genres that have dominated the box office each year. Surprisingly, the number of films winning the weekend box office in various genres varies widely from year to year. Genres like Action and Drama often cover the majority of box office winners. However, this pattern can be explained by the infrequent release of big franchise movies. Producing such films entails significant costs and time, resulting in less frequent releases. Conversely, there is a consistent influx of drama and low-budget movies being released every week, contributing to a more diverse distribution of box office results across genres.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother layer of analysis worth exploring is whether critically acclaimed movies tend to top the box office or not. To investigate this, the plot above utilizes data from Rotten Tomatoes, the most widely recognized platform for aggregating critic movie reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, movies are categorized as either “Fresh” or “Rotten.” “Fresh” signifies movies with ratings above 60%, indicating that 60% or more of critics gave the film a positive review, while the rest are considered “Rotten.”\nExamining the distribution of movies in these two categories is quite intriguing. It reveals an almost even split, with roughly half of the movies classified as “Fresh” and the other half as “Rotten.” This suggests that there isn’t an overwhelming reliance on a movie’s critical reception for its opening weekend success. However, the story may differ when considering a movie’s long-term box office performance, as a film is less likely to have staying power if it doesn’t receive positive reviews from critics.\nThis observation could be a subtle indication that factors like hype and marketing might exert a more significant influence on a movie’s opening weekend performance compared to critic ratings. For instance, franchises like “Fast & Furious” consistently perform well in their opening weekends despite not always receiving favorable critical acclaim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis analysis delves into the financial sector of the movie industry, specifically highlighting stock performances of major Hollywood studios. Our focus is on Disney, Paramount, Lionsgate, Warner Bros, and Netflix. While there are numerous studios in the industry, these selected entities provide a comprehensive insight into the sector’s financial landscape. Notably, we’ve included Netflix to represent the growing impact of streaming services in this traditionally cinema-focused industry.\nA standout observation is Netflix’s meteoric rise in stock prices. The growth trajectory of Netflix’s stock, in many instances, has eclipsed the combined growth of some of the other studios. This surge underscores investors’ confidence in Netflix’s future potential. It suggests a broader industry trend where streaming platforms could challenge, if not dethrone, traditional movie theaters as the primary venues for film viewing. The rise of Netflix is not just a testament to its success as a streaming service but positions it as a formidable player in the entertainment sector, transcending its initial label as merely a tech company.\nHowever, a nuanced view, especially when analyzing normalized stock prices, reveals a consistent growth story for Disney. Unlike the erratic stock performances of other studios, Disney’s stock has shown steady growth. Curiously, despite Netflix’s overwhelming growth in absolute terms, when assessed against normalized metrics, its behavior mirrors that of other major studios. A potential explanation could be the cyclical nature of the industry, marked by periods of hit releases and lulls, impacting all players uniformly over time.\nOn the cinematic front, Paramount historically dominated the charts, boasting the highest number of weekly box office toppers for an extended period. However, the tide seemed to turn in favor of Disney. This shift is unsurprising, given Disney’s strategic acquisitions over the years. Their portfolio now includes powerhouses like Marvel, Lucasfilm, and Pixar. The consistent release of blockbuster titles from these franchises has cemented Disney’s position at the pinnacle of box office charts.\nIn summary, while streaming giants like Netflix are making waves in the stock market, traditional studios, especially Disney, with its strategic acquisitions and diverse portfolio, continue to hold their ground, both in stock performance and cinematic dominance."

Instead, it exhibits a recurrent pattern reminiscent of an “A,” albeit with varying magnitudes across different periods. However, the year 2020 stands out as an exceptional anomaly in this pattern, as the unemployment rate soared to an all-time high. This significant spike in unemployment in 2020 can be readily attributed to the profound impact that the COVID-19 pandemic had on society, causing widespread economic disruptions and leading to substantial job losses. Consequently, while the unemployment rate’s historical fluctuations may follow a recurring pattern, the unprecedented events of 2020 underline the disruptive force of external factors on the labor market."

    "text": "Exploratory Data Analysis\n\nLag plots\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Lag Plots\n\n\nThe graph above depicts a series of lag plots for the “Opening Weekend Box Office” data. Lag plots are scatter plots of a time series against a lag of itself, and they provide a useful graphical representation of whether a dataset (or time series) is random or not. A dataset is considered random if the points in the lag plot are randomly scattered around the horizontal axis, without any discernible pattern. In contrast, if there’s a structure in the lag plot, the dataset can be considered to exhibit some form of serial correlation.\nIn this particular visualization, four lag plots are shown, corresponding to lags of 1, 15, 30, and 52 (weeks). For the lag 1 plot, there’s a clear linear trend, indicating strong serial correlation from one data point to the next. This suggests that the box office data of a particular weekend is closely related to the previous weekend’s data. As the lag value increases (15, 30, and 52), the structure in the plots starts to diminish. While there’s still some correlation at lag 15, it becomes weaker at lags 30 and 52. This implies that the immediate past (a few weeks prior) has a more significant impact on current weekend box office performance than the more distant past.\nThe implications for time series modeling here are multifaceted. First, since there’s a noticeable correlation at lag 1, autoregressive (AR) terms would be significant in an ARIMA model. Given the diminishing correlation in higher lags, differencing the series might be beneficial to make it stationary, which is often a prerequisite for ARIMA modeling. Additionally, the weakening correlations as the lag increases suggest that recent historical data will have more predictive power than older data. This insight can guide feature engineering for machine learning-based approaches, where recent past values might be given higher importance. Lastly, considering the temporal patterns, special events, movie releases, or holidays might be driving specific peaks or troughs in the box office data, and integrating such external factors into the model might enhance its predictive accuracy.\n\n\nDecomposed Series\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Decomposed Series\n\n\nFigure 2 displayed represents the decomposition of a multiplicative time series into its individual components: data, trend, seasonal, and remainder. Time series decomposition is a statistical method used to deconstruct a time series into these components, making it easier to identify patterns and irregularities.\n\nData: The topmost panel displays the raw time series data. We observe fluctuations and variability, which makes it challenging to discern a clear pattern or trend merely by looking at this raw data. The values range between near 0M to roughly 400M, showcasing the volatility and potential seasonality in the data.\nTrend: The second panel presents the trend component of the data. The trend represents the underlying movement in the series, disregarding the noise or short-term fluctuations. In this case, there’s a slight upward trend, indicating an increase in the data’s values over time. There are also noticeable fluctuations in the trend, suggesting that while the general direction might be upward, there are periods of decline and rise.\nSeasonal: The third panel showcases the seasonal component. In time series analysis, seasonality refers to periodic fluctuations. For instance, sales might be consistently high during Christmas or summer every year. The black bars indicate a strong and consistent seasonal pattern. The repetition at fixed intervals underscores the presence of a well-defined seasonality in the data. Another reason for this very “all over the place” behavior in seasonality is the fact that there are thousands of weeks (over 40 years worth od data). A sample version (only for a year) will be conducted under this section to analyze seasonality at a more granular level.\nRemainder (or Residual): The bottom panel represents the residuals or the remainder of the data once the trend and seasonality have been extracted. It essentially captures the noise or the unpredictability in the data. Observing this plot, there are sporadic spikes, suggesting that while most of the data’s behavior can be explained by its trend and seasonality, there are still some unexplained or unexpected fluctuations.\n\nOverall this particular time series exhibits a clear seasonality, a slightly upward trend, and sporadic unexpected fluctuations. Recognizing these components is beneficial for businesses or analysts as they can plan and strategize based on the predictable pattern (trend and seasonality) and also allocate resources to investigate the cause of any anomalies or unexpected fluctuations (residuals).\n\n\nSampled Decomposed Series\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Sampled decomposition plots (year 2020)\n\n\nFigure 3 is the same exact analysis done in Figure 2 but only for one year worth of data, with the intent of reducing the data points we are analyzing to have a clearer view at the seasonality of our data. The figure illustrates distinct cyclical variations in weekly box office returns throughout 2020. These oscillations appear to be periodic, suggesting that certain weeks consistently witnessed higher or lower box office returns.\nThe regularity of these oscillations might be linked to various factors specific to the film industry. For instance, certain times of the year, such as holiday seasons, school vacations, or periods associated with major film releases, could see heightened box office activity. Conversely, periods with no major releases or outside of vacation times might register lower returns. The consistent peaks and troughs indicate that there are predictable times in the year when movies are either raking in higher ticket sales or experiencing a slump.\nThe magnitude of the seasonal component’s oscillations seems relatively consistent across the time series, suggesting that while the exact figures might change, the pattern of highs and lows remained steady throughout the year.\nFor film industry stakeholders, such a pronounced seasonal pattern is invaluable. Distributors, production houses, and theater chains can leverage this data to strategically time their film releases, marketing pushes, or even theater maintenance downtimes.\n\n\nMoving Averages\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Moving Averages Analysis\n\n\nFigure 4 presents a comparative analysis of the moving averages for the weekend box office data across different windows of time. Each subplot offers a distinct moving average, computed over periods of 5, 25, 52, and 100 days, respectively.\nAt first glance, the ma_5 (red line) captures the short-term fluctuations of the box office performance with high fidelity. It is closely aligned with the raw data, highlighting the immediate ups and downs of weekend revenues. Such a short window moving average is typically sensitive to sudden changes, making it ideal for detecting rapid shifts in data. However, this can also mean that it’s more prone to noise, which might not always be indicative of an overarching trend.\nIn contrast, the ma_100 (purple line) provides a smoother, longer-term perspective on box office performance. This curve abstracts away short-term volatility, offering a more consolidated view that emphasizes the broader trajectory of revenues over the given period. Such a depiction is instrumental in understanding overarching trends, seasonality, and potential cyclic behaviors.\nThe ma_25 (blue line) and ma_52 (green line) offer intermediate perspectives, balancing between capturing immediate changes and identifying longer-term patterns. Notably, the ma_52, representing a year’s worth of weeks, gives insights into annual seasonality, highlighting periods of consistently high or low revenues.\nIn the realm of the film industry, such moving averages serve pivotal roles. For instance, the ma_5 can inform immediate reactions, such as marketing boosts or schedule changes, in response to sudden shifts in viewer interest. Longer-term averages, like ma_100, can aid in strategic planning, providing insights into best times for big-budget releases or anticipating annual slumps. When combined, these moving averages offer a comprehensive overview, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions, whether they’re looking to address immediate concerns or strategize for the future.\n\n\nACF and PCF\n\n\n\nFigure 5: ACF\n\n\nFigure 5 showcases the autocorrelation function (ACF) for the weekend box office data. Autocorrelation measures how a series is correlated with its past values. Essentially, it provides insights into the relationship between an observation and a lagged version of itself over successive time intervals. The “Lag” on the x-axis indicates the number of time periods separating the two sets of values being compared.\nAt the very beginning (lag 0), the autocorrelation is 1, as any dataset is perfectly correlated with itself. As we move to the right, the chart depicts how the box office performance is related to its past values over weekly lags. The fact that the values remain relatively high for the initial lags and gradually taper off indicates that the box office data for a particular weekend is somewhat influenced by the recent past weekends. This could imply that the performance of movies tends to have momentum—either carrying forward strong or weak performances from the previous weeks.\nThe blue dashed lines indicate the significance threshold. Correlations lying outside these lines are statistically significant, meaning they are likely not a result of random fluctuations. Notably, many lags have bars surpassing this threshold, especially in the initial phase, signifying meaningful autocorrelation. This suggests that a significant amount of the variability in the box office data can be predicted from its past values.\nFor the film industry, understanding this autocorrelation is valuable. If recent weeks’ box office performances have a strong influence on subsequent weeks, then marketers, distributors, and theatre owners can strategize accordingly. For instance, if a particular genre or a movie is performing exceptionally well in consecutive weeks, it might be beneficial to prolong its screening, capitalize on marketing momentum, or release similarly themed movies. Conversely, if a film starts to underperform, stakeholders might consider changing strategies swiftly, considering the influence of recent data on the immediate future.\n\n\n\nFigure 6: PACF\n\n\nOn the other hand, Figure 6 us displays the partial autocorrelation function (PACF) for weekend box office data. PACF is a crucial diagnostic tool in time series analysis, specifically used to ascertain the relationship between an observation and its lag, after removing the effects of intermediate lags. In simpler terms, while ACF measures raw correlations, PACF measures correlations after accounting for any shared correlations with the intermediate time steps.\nObserving the chart, the y-axis denotes the partial autocorrelation value and the x-axis indicates the number of lags. The bar at lag 0 is always 1 since an observation is always perfectly correlated with itself. The subsequent bars provide the partial autocorrelation for each lag. Notably, the majority of the lags appear to have bars that fall within the blue dashed lines, which depict the significance threshold. PACF values within these boundaries are generally considered not statistically significant, implying they could arise from random variations.\nIn the context of the box office data, a few specific lags have partial autocorrelations that surpass the significance thresholds, particularly in the initial lags. This suggests that, while there’s some predictability in the data based on very recent past weekends, the influence of more distant past weekends is less clear, after accounting for more recent data.\n\n\nADF Test\nThe Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test is a statistical test commonly used to test whether a time series has a unit root, i.e., it is non-stationary. A unit root suggests that the series might exhibit a systematic pattern over time, which can be a problem in many statistical modeling techniques. Ideally, for modeling purposes (like ARIMA), it’s often desired that time series data be stationary, meaning its properties do not depend on the time at which the series is observed.\nRunning the data on my data, i got a value of -6.8219, strongly negating the null hypothesis of a unit root, which implies stationarity. This is further bolstered by the p-value of 0.01, which is a robust evidence against the series having a unit root, suggesting the acf series’ stationarity.\nGiven this, the alternative hypothesis, which posits that the data is stationary, is preferred. Essentially, the ADF test result signals that your acf series is stationary, implying that differencing might be unnecessary for removing non-stationary patterns."

    "text": "One of the most obvious facts is that certain types of movies consistently outperform others at the box office. For instance, franchise movies, such as superhero films, have consistently demonstrated stronger performance compared to other genres. Remarkably, when we examine the top 10 highest-grossing movies of all time, only one, “Titanic,” does not belong to a major intellectual property or franchise. Therefore, it is sensible to analyze the top box office performers within different genres over time.\nThe animated plot presented above illustrates the genres that have dominated the box office each year. Surprisingly, the number of films winning the weekend box office in various genres varies widely from year to year. Genres like Action and Drama often cover the majority of box office winners. However, this pattern can be explained by the infrequent release of big franchise movies. Producing such films entails significant costs and time, resulting in less frequent releases. Conversely, there is a consistent influx of drama and low-budget movies being released every week, contributing to a more diverse distribution of box office results across genres."

    "text": "Another layer of analysis worth exploring is whether critically acclaimed movies tend to top the box office or not. To investigate this, the plot above utilizes data from Rotten Tomatoes, the most widely recognized platform for aggregating critic movie reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, movies are categorized as either “Fresh” or “Rotten.” “Fresh” signifies movies with ratings above 60%, indicating that 60% or more of critics gave the film a positive review, while the rest are considered “Rotten.”\nExamining the distribution of movies in these two categories is quite intriguing. It reveals an almost even split, with roughly half of the movies classified as “Fresh” and the other half as “Rotten.” This suggests that there isn’t an overwhelming reliance on a movie’s critical reception for its opening weekend success. However, the story may differ when considering a movie’s long-term box office performance, as a film is less likely to have staying power if it doesn’t receive positive reviews from critics.\nThis observation could be a subtle indication that factors like hype and marketing might exert a more significant influence on a movie’s opening weekend performance compared to critic ratings. For instance, franchises like “Fast & Furious” consistently perform well in their opening weekends despite not always receiving favorable critical acclaim."

    "text": "This analysis delves into the financial sector of the movie industry, specifically highlighting stock performances of major Hollywood studios. Our focus is on Disney, Paramount, Lionsgate, Warner Bros, and Netflix. While there are numerous studios in the industry, these selected entities provide a comprehensive insight into the sector’s financial landscape. Notably, we’ve included Netflix to represent the growing impact of streaming services in this traditionally cinema-focused industry.\nA standout observation is Netflix’s meteoric rise in stock prices. The growth trajectory of Netflix’s stock, in many instances, has eclipsed the combined growth of some of the other studios. This surge underscores investors’ confidence in Netflix’s future potential. It suggests a broader industry trend where streaming platforms could challenge, if not dethrone, traditional movie theaters as the primary venues for film viewing. The rise of Netflix is not just a testament to its success as a streaming service but positions it as a formidable player in the entertainment sector, transcending its initial label as merely a tech company.\nHowever, a nuanced view, especially when analyzing normalized stock prices, reveals a consistent growth story for Disney. Unlike the erratic stock performances of other studios, Disney’s stock has shown steady growth. Curiously, despite Netflix’s overwhelming growth in absolute terms, when assessed against normalized metrics, its behavior mirrors that of other major studios. A potential explanation could be the cyclical nature of the industry, marked by periods of hit releases and lulls, impacting all players uniformly over time.\nOn the cinematic front, Paramount historically dominated the charts, boasting the highest number of weekly box office toppers for an extended period. However, the tide seemed to turn in favor of Disney. This shift is unsurprising, given Disney’s strategic acquisitions over the years. Their portfolio now includes powerhouses like Marvel, Lucasfilm, and Pixar. The consistent release of blockbuster titles from these franchises has cemented Disney’s position at the pinnacle of box office charts.\nIn summary, while streaming giants like Netflix are making waves in the stock market, traditional studios, especially Disney, with its strategic acquisitions and diverse portfolio, continue to hold their ground, both in stock performance and cinematic dominance."
